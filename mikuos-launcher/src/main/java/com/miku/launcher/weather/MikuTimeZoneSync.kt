/**
 * Keeps the system time zone following the device around the country.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The M500's clock is correct in absolute terms: `auto_time` is on and NTP keeps
 * UTC honest. What does not follow is the ZONE, so after a flight the device shows the right
 * instant rendered in the wrong place, and every clock, alarm and "2 min ago" in the OS is off by
 * however many hours you travelled.
 *
 * Android's own `auto_time_zone` is already on and does not help here, because the mechanism behind
 * it is NITZ, which arrives over the carrier signalling channel. This device runs a data-only SIM
 * whose PS registration is frequently DENIED (rejectCause 7), and no registration means no NITZ,
 * ever. Waiting for the carrier to tell us the zone is waiting for something that is not coming.
 *
 * WHAT IT USES INSTEAD. The launcher already resolves a position for the weather tile and already
 * asks Open-Meteo with `timezone=auto`, and Open-Meteo already answers with the IANA zone for those
 * coordinates. `MikuWeatherTileSources` has been parsing it into `WxSnapshot.tzId` the whole time
 * and nothing ever did anything with it. This applies it. No new network call, no new permission
 * beyond SET_TIME_ZONE, no extra battery.
 *
 * THE OBVIOUS CAVEAT. This is only ever as good as the position, and the position on this device
 * comes from Wi-Fi scanning, which has a known failure mode: access points that TRAVEL WITH YOU
 * (a hotspot, a Starlink terminal, your own gear in the car) are still mapped at the place they
 * were surveyed, so the fix can lag reality by a whole country. `MikuWifiLocator` excludes those,
 * but it cannot be perfect. Two guards follow from that:
 *
 *  1. Never move the zone on a position the weather engine did not trust enough to render.
 *  2. Leave the user a switch. `miku_auto_timezone` in Settings.Global, default on, 0 pins the
 *     zone. Anyone who has been bitten by a wrong guess can turn it off and set it by hand.
 *
 * It also stands down when the user has turned Android's own `auto_time_zone` off, because that is
 * them saying they want to control the clock, and it would be rude to override it from a weather
 * refresh.
