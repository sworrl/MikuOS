/**
 * A single GPS fix, taken deliberately and then left alone.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `requestLocationUpdates`. The M500 has real GNSS hardware: it declares
 * `android.hardware.location.gps`, the provider registers with `requires=satellite` and a real HAL
 * (`GNSS Hardware Model Name: aidl-impl`). The launcher used to use it, and it was pulled out
 * because it flattened the battery. On a device whose whole job is playing music for a day on one
 * charge, a continuously subscribed GPS is not a rounding error.
 *
 * So this never subscribes. It asks for ONE fix through `getCurrentLocation`, with a cancellation
 * signal and a hard timeout, and the radio goes back to sleep either way. The call site is the
 * weather refresh, which is already throttled, so the worst case is one bounded acquisition per
 * refresh window rather than a permanent listener.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH DOING AT ALL. The previous code only ever called `getLastKnownLocation`, which
 * is a passive read of a cache somebody else has to fill. Nothing on this device fills it: the
 * dump showed `locations = 0` for every provider over ten hours and the GNSS service active for
 * 2.6 seconds total. That branch could never return anything, so position always fell through to
 * Wi-Fi scanning, which is the source with the known travelling-access-point failure mode. Asking
 * the satellites directly removes the guesswork when it works.
 *
 * WHY WI-FI STAYS. A GPS fix needs sky. This is a pocket player used indoors most of the time, so
 * acquisition will often fail, and it takes tens of seconds when it succeeds from cold. GPS is the
 * preferred source, not the only one, and the caller falls through on null exactly as before.
