/**
 * MikuOS Theming Engine — data model + runtime-selectable theme registry.
 *
 * This file is intentionally self-contained (pure data + a persisted StateFlow) and is NOT
 * wired into MikuLauncherActivity.kt. Wiring — reading [MikuThemeRegistry.selectedTheme],
 * applying [MikuTheme.wallpaperAsset] as the home/lock background, and recoloring UI chrome
 * from [MikuAccentPalette] — is a separate follow-up pass, done by whoever owns the activity.
 *
 * See docs/10_miku_theme_catalog.md for the full asset catalog, source-image inventory, and
 * per-theme suggested palettes this registry was seeded from.
 *
 * ### Asset resolution model
 * Themes deliberately do NOT hold compile-time `@DrawableRes Int` references, because the
 * underlying bitmaps (miku-assets/themes/<id>/wallpaper.*) are not yet copied into any
 * module's res/drawable-nodpi at the time this registry was authored. Instead each theme
 * carries the *drawable resource name it expects to exist* as a String, and callers resolve
 * it at runtime with [MikuThemeRegistry.resolveDrawableRes] (falls back to the Default
 * theme's drawable, then to 0 / "not found", if the name hasn't been wired into res/ yet).
 * This keeps the registry compilable today and forward-compatible once the real drawables
 * are added under names like `theme_default_wallpaper`, `theme_cyber_stage_wallpaper`, etc.

 * @param id stable machine id, persisted to SharedPreferences — never rename once shipped.
 * @param displayName human-readable name shown in the theme picker.
 * @param description one-line blurb for the picker UI.
 * @param wallpaperDrawableName expected res/drawable(-nodpi) resource name for the home
 *   wallpaper (see [MikuThemeRegistry.resolveDrawableRes]).
 * @param lockscreenDrawableName expected resource name for the lockscreen wallpaper. Many
 *   themes reuse the home wallpaper; pass the same name in that case.
 * @param accentPalette the recolor tokens this theme pushes when applied.
 * @param keyboardThemeRef optional id of a matching IME/keyboard theme (see
 *   docs/10_miku_theme_catalog.md §4 for AOSP LatinIME feasibility notes). Null = no matching
 *   keyboard skin exists yet.
 * @param hasRealArt false = the wallpaper is a stand-in/placeholder, not the art the theme is
 *   actually named after. UI should badge these as "preview" until real art lands. Every built-in
 *   theme now ships its own art; when wiring the picker, prefer deriving this from an actual
 *   resolveDrawableRes() hit rather than trusting this hand-maintained flag to stay accurate.
