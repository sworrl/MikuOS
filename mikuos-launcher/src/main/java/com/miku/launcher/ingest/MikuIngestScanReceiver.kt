/**
 * Index what the ingress relay just pushed, from outside the UI.
 *
 *   adb shell am broadcast -a com.miku.launcher.action.INGEST_SCAN -p com.miku.launcher
 *
 * This closes the loop on a sync. The host relay (`tools/ingress-relay/relay.py`) pushes files
 * over adb, which writes them straight to the card without MediaStore ever hearing about it, so
 * without this the device holds the music and shows none of it until something else happens to
 * trigger a scan. The relay fires this as its last step.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate action from REFRESH_LOCATION's pattern of doing the work inline: a scan
 * can take a while, and `triggerForceScan` already runs on the engine's own scope, so this returns
 * immediately rather than holding the broadcast open.
