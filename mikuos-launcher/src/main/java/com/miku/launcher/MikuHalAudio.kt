/**
 * The channel that actually moves this device's DAC, without root.
 *
 * WHY. [CirrusLogicManager]'s setters wrote `Settings.Global` rows and then handed the real work
 * to `RootShell.execFast("echo … > /sys/… ; setprop …")`. There is no `su` on MikuOS — the OS is
 * unrestricted by platform-signing instead — so every one of those shell lines was a no-op, while
 * the Settings row the UI reads back changed. The control screen therefore echoed each choice
 * straight back as if the hardware had taken it. That is the same defect class as the gain bug
 * found live on 2026-09-11 (`hw.gain=low` while the UI claimed otherwise, IEMs quiet), and the
 * player module fixed its own copy by routing through the audio HAL. The launcher never got that
 * fix, so its entire DAC surface was decorative.
 *
 * HOW. `AudioManager.setParameters` is the documented way to hand a key=value pair to the audio
 * HAL, needs no root and no privileged permission, and the HiBy HAL on this unit consumes the
 * `vendor.audio.hiby.*` keys through it. This is the one route confirmed to reach the DACs.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot write a sysfs node the HAL does not expose as a parameter. Where a
 * setting has no HAL key, the honest outcome is that it does not apply, and the nullable readers
 * in [CirrusLogicManager] will report null rather than our own last write. Do not add a `su`
 * fallback to paper over that: see m500-no-su-platform-signed-directive.
