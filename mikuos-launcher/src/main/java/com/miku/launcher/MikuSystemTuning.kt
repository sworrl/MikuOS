/**
 * The startup tuning the launcher applies to make the device reachable and usable, done with
 * platform APIs instead of a root shell.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `MikuLauncherActivity.onCreate` used to hand a 19-command string to
 * `RootShell.execFast`. MikuOS has no root and never will, so every launch produced
 * `Cannot run program "su": error=2, No such file or directory`, RootShell backed off for 120
 * seconds, and NOT ONE of those nineteen settings was ever applied.
 *
 * Every one of those commands has a first-class API behind it, and a platform-signed app holds the
 * permissions they need: WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS for the `settings put` lines,
 * MANAGE_APP_OPS_MODES for `appops set`, GRANT_RUNTIME_PERMISSIONS for `pm grant`. This is the
 * standing rule in practice: a `su` failure here was a code bug, not a reason to install Magisk.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CARRIED OVER. The original string also ran `setprop` on four
 * `persist.*` / `service.adb.*` properties and then `stop adbd; start adbd`. Those are not
 * available to us and no amount of signing changes it: the property contexts are owned by the
 * `adbd` domain and `stop`/`start` are init verbs for the shell. They are dropped rather than
 * attempted-and-swallowed, because a call that cannot work should not look like one that might.
 * `Settings.Global.ADB_WIFI_ENABLED` is the supported route to the same outcome on Android 11 and
 * later, and it is set here.
