/**
 * Beat-match judgment tier for the rhythm game, seasons engine and incremental clicker.

 * Five graded tiers instead of the old three-value PERFECT/GOOD/MISS: a rhythm game teaches
 * timing through the *gradient* between tiers. With only "perfect or good" a player who is
 * 35 ms out and a player who is 85 ms out get the same word back and learn nothing.
 *
 * Every payout weight a tier carries lives here, so the economy, the season points and the
 * haptic weight all move together and there is exactly one table to tune.
 *
 * - [growsCombo]  the combo counter advances (PERFECT/GREAT/GOOD)
 * - [keepsCombo]  the combo survives but does not advance (OK — "you stayed alive")
 * - MISS does neither, unless a combo shield absorbs it (see MikuBeatClickerEngine).

 * The rhythm game's timing model: graded hit windows, the on-beat deadzone, the adaptive

 *
 * WINDOW REASONING (HiBy M500, 60 Hz panel)
 * -----------------------------------------
 * One display frame is 16.7 ms, and a capacitive panel sampled at 60-120 Hz adds another
 * frame or so of jitter before a touch even reaches us. So a window tighter than ~2 frames
 * is not something a player can *aim* at — it is noise, and grading on it feels arbitrary.
 * Hence:
 *   DEADZONE ±18 ms  (~1 frame)   — inside this the deviation is not meaningfully measurable,
 *                                   so it reads as a clean "ON BEAT" with no early/late arrow.
 *   PERFECT  ±32 ms  (~2 frames)  — the tightest window a human can repeatedly hit here.
 *   GREAT    ±58 ms  (~3.5 frames)
 *   GOOD     ±95 ms
 *   OK       ±140 ms              — still a hit; keeps the combo alive but does not build it.
 *   beyond   = MISS
 * These are half-widths (±), matching how rhythm games quote them.
 *
 * Windows are additionally capped at [MAX_WINDOW_BEAT_FRACTION] of the beat period, because a
 * window wider than half a beat would overlap the *next* beat and every tap would "hit"
 * something. At 220 BPM (273 ms/beat) that clamps OK to ±125 ms; below ~205 BPM nothing
 * clamps at all.
