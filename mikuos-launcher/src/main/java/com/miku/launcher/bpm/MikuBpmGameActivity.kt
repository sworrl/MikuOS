/**
 * The BPM game as a real Activity, so it can be opened from anywhere and closes back to wherever
 * the player was.
 *
 * WHY. The game used to exist only as a modal inside the home screen. Opening it from Miku Music
 * meant launching the launcher, which put the player on the home screen with the game over it;
 * closing the game left them on home, not on the Now Playing screen they came from.
 *
 * RETURN-TO-ORIGIN is done with the task stack, not with bookkeeping:
 *  - Started from an Activity (Now Playing, the home screen, the app drawer) WITHOUT
 *    FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK, this activity stacks on top of the caller's own task. Closing it is
 *    finish(), and the caller is simply what is underneath.
 *  - Started from a widget or any other non-Activity context it needs NEW_TASK; its private
 *    taskAffinity and excludeFromRecents keep it from dragging the home task forward or leaving a
 *    stray recents card, so finish() again returns to whatever was in front.
 *
 * CONTRACT for other apps (see [open]):
 *   component  com.miku.launcher/com.miku.launcher.bpm.MikuBpmGameActivity
 *   action     com.miku.action.OPEN_BPM_GAME
 *   extra      "from" (String, optional): where it was opened from, e.g. now_playing
 *
 * The home-screen modal still works exactly as before; both host the same composable.
