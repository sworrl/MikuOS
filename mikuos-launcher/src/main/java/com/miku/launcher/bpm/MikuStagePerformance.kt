/**
 * The part that makes it a GAME instead of a metronome with a score attached.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. The engine underneath is a good systems game: graded timing, a combo ladder,
 * shields, adaptive difficulty, a skill tree that does something. None of it can make you laugh,
 * because nothing in it is WATCHING YOU. You tapped, a number went up, and the number going up was
 * the whole event. There was no opponent, no stakes, and nothing that could surprise you.
 *
 * This adds the four things that were actually absent:
 *
 *  1. A CROWD, which is a resource you can lose. Miss enough and they walk out and the set is over.
 *     Every tap now has a consequence in a direction that matters.
 *  2. MIKU, reacting. She has a mood that tracks how you are doing and gets progressively less
 *     professional about it in both directions.
 *  3. CHAOS. Announced, time-boxed mutators that really change the rules, not cosmetic overlays.
 *  4. A HECKLER, who is a joke and a mechanic at once: shut them up by playing well.
 *
 * Everything here reads state the engine already measures. Nothing invents a performance number.
