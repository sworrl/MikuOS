/**
 * Tempo LOCK for the live output-mix beat detector.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. [MikuLiveBeatDetector] produces one tempo ESTIMATE per detected onset, from the
 * median of the last few inter-onset intervals. That estimate is noisy by construction: a vocal
 * transient, a cymbal, a fill, a bar of silence or a slightly swung hat all move it by a few BPM.
 * Publishing every estimate made the readout flicker (e.g. 126 → 129 → 124 → 127) while a track
 * played at one constant tempo — which reads as broken, and makes a rhythm game whose target
 * visibly wobbles unplayable.
 *
 * THE FIX is a lock, not a smoother. A smoother still moves the number on every onset; a lock
 * picks one value and then holds it:
 *
 *  1. ACQUIRE — collect estimates until [ACQUIRE_SAMPLES] of them agree with each other inside
 *     the detector's own tolerance, then LOCK to their median. Until that happens the published
 *     tempo is nothing at all: the UI shows "listening…", never a confident number that no
 *     agreement backs. (Standing rule on this project: honest no-data beats a flattering guess.)
 *  2. HOLD — while locked, an agreeing estimate changes NOTHING. The displayed value is not
 *     re-derived, re-averaged or nudged; it is the same number until the lock actually breaks.
 *  3. HYSTERESIS — one disagreeing estimate is an outlier and is ignored (it only arms a counter,
 *     and a single agreeing estimate disarms it again). The lock only breaks when
 *     [RELOCK_SAMPLES] consecutive estimates disagree with the locked tempo AND agree with each
 *     other — i.e. sustained evidence of a genuinely different tempo, at which point it re-locks
 *     straight onto that new tempo.
 *  4. OCTAVE TOLERANCE — this detector is octave-ambiguous by nature (it triggers on kick energy,
 *     so it happily reports half or double time when the drum pattern changes). An estimate at
 *     ~0.5x / 2x / 4x the locked tempo is the SAME tempo and keeps the lock untouched.
 *  5. TRACK CHANGE — a new track is not an outlier, it is a new question. The lock is dropped
 *     immediately and acquisition restarts, rather than waiting out the hysteresis.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from real measured onsets. The lock never invents a tempo, and a
 * value only becomes visible once the evidence for it exists.
