/**
 * Game-feel events: the centre "pop" text and the sheet shake.
 *
 * These are the two cheapest pieces of juice that do the most work. A rung crossing, a fever, a
 * lucky note or a record has to land in the player's PERIPHERAL vision, because on a hit their
 * eye is already on the next note — a small floating number does not register there, a big pop
 * and a few pixels of shake do.
 *
 * Engine code fires these; the modal's FX layer renders them. Plain state flows with an id, so a
 * repeat of the same text still re-triggers, and nothing here allocates per frame.
