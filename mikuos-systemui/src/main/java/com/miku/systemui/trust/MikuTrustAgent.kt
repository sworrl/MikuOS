/**
 * MikuOS trust agent: the part that makes "PIN after a restart, not at every unlock" work.
 *
 * Android needs the credential after every restart to unlock credential encrypted storage. That
 * stays. After that first unlock this agent grants trust, so the keyguard opens with a swipe on
 * the Miku lockscreen until the next restart.
 *
 * The grant is "temporary and renewable" (Android 14 active unlock style): when the screen turns
 * off, the system drops it to "trustable", and this agent renews it when the screen turns on.
 * Renewing only works from "trustable", which the system only reaches after a real credential
 * unlock, so the agent cannot open a device the user has not unlocked since restart.
 *
 * Limits the system enforces, which this does not fight:
 *  - The credential is needed again 24 hours after it was last entered (trustable hard timeout).
 *  - It is also needed when no renewal happened for 8 hours, for example the screen stayed off
 *    overnight (trustable idle timeout).
 *  - Trust is never allowed while strong auth is required: after a restart, after a lockdown,
 *    after too many wrong tries, or after 72 hours without the credential.
 *
 * With Settings.Secure miku_lock_trust_until_restart = 0 the agent only holds trust for the
 * unlock that was just made with the credential, and drops it when the screen turns off, so the
 * credential is asked every time.
 *
 * Enabled through LockPatternUtils.setEnabledTrustAgents by MikuSettings when a screen lock is
 * set. The system only binds it while a credential exists and trust is allowed.
