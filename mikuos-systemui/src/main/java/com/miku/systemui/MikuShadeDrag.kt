/**
 * Process-wide bridge between the navigation service's top strip (which owns the finger — an
 * accessibility overlay keeps the pointer for the whole gesture) and MikuShadeActivity, so the
 * shade can follow the finger 1:1 after it has been launched mid-pull, and settle with the real
 * release velocity. Both live in the com.miku.systemui process.

 *   velocityPxS vertical velocity at release (+ = downward)
 *   serial      bumps on every new pull so a stale release is never applied to a new panel
