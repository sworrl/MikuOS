/**
 * OS-WIDE IDLE DIM + TAP-TO-AWAKEN.
 *
 * The problem this solves: the panel had `screen_off_timeout = 15000` and NO dim stage, so the
 * screen cut straight from full brightness to black 15 seconds after the last touch. There is no
 * double-tap-to-wake on this hardware (`doze_pulse_on_double_tap` is null, no dt2w node/props), so
 * the touch panel almost certainly powers down with the display — a "tap to wake a dark screen"
 * design would simply not work here. The design is therefore: keep the display ON but take it very
 * dim, so the digitizer stays powered and ANY touch restores full brightness instantly.
 *
 * MECHANISM — real system backlight, not a dark overlay.
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The dim is applied by writing `Settings.System.SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS` (verified on-device: the panel
 * is in MANUAL mode with brightness 82/255, and writing 20 / 82 dims and restores the backlight
 * immediately). This was chosen over the obvious alternative (a full-screen black scrim window in
 * the accessibility overlay layer) because:
 *   · it dims the actual BACKLIGHT, so it genuinely saves power — a scrim saves nothing, the panel
 *     still burns the same current behind a black rectangle. Battery matters on this device.
 *   · it applies to every app without owning that app's window. `WindowManager.LayoutParams
 *     .screenBrightness` is a PER-WINDOW override; the launcher and lockscreen own windows but
 *     Spotify/Chrome/Settings do not, so a per-window approach could never be OS-wide.
 *   · it puts no window in front of everything else, so nothing can intercept, obscure or delay a
 *     touch. The waking touch reaches the app it was aimed at, untouched — no tap-twice.
 *
 * TOUCH DETECTION — a 1x1 px watcher window, never in the touch path.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A one-pixel, fully transparent accessibility-overlay window carries FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH.
 * The input dispatcher delivers MotionEvent.ACTION_OUTSIDE to such a window on the DOWN of every
 * gesture that lands anywhere else on screen, WITHOUT consuming that gesture — the app below still
 * receives the whole stream normally. That gives "any touch, anywhere, in any app, at DOWN" for
 * the cost of one invisible pixel and zero interference. (It is added before the nav overlays so
 * the shade strip sits above it; a literal touch on pixel 0,0 is handled too, and returns false.)
 * Keys (including the volume knob) come through the service's own onKeyEvent, and coarse
 * accessibility events (click / scroll / app switch) are a third, redundant source.
 *
 * THE LADDER (all timings user-settable, see [MikuIdleDimSettings]):
 *   ACTIVE                       → the user's own brightness.
 *   DIM     after activeSec      → 25% of the user's brightness (min 4), ramped down over 800ms.
 *   AMBIENT after +dimSec        → 6% of the user's brightness (min 1), ramped over 800ms.
 *   OFF     after +ambientSec    → left to the PLATFORM: `screen_off_timeout` is set to the total
 *                                  ladder length, so Android's own power manager blanks the panel
 *                                  exactly when the ladder ends. We never hold a wakelock and never
 *                                  push the timeout out indefinitely, so the device can ALWAYS
 *                                  still sleep — this device has a history of idle-drain bugs.
 *
 * COSTS NOTHING WHILE IDLE: there is no polling loop of any kind. Each tier schedules exactly ONE
 * Handler.postDelayed for the next boundary; between boundaries the process is completely silent.
 * The 800ms ramp is ~13 posts and then stops. When the real display goes off (ACTION_SCREEN_OFF)
 * every callback is cancelled, the user's brightness is restored and nothing runs until the screen
 * comes back. Settings are read via ContentObserver, never re-polled.
