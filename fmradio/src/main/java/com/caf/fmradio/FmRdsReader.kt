/**
 * RDS decoded from the Si4705, by reading /dev/radio0 directly.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE API WE ALREADY HAVE. `FmReceiver.getPSInfo()` / `getRTInfo()` / `getRTPlusInfo()`
 * are the QTI HCI API, and on this board that talks to the Qualcomm WCN FM core, which has no
 * antenna: it reads RSSI 0 at every frequency in the band. Its RDS callbacks will therefore
 * never fire with anything. The part that receives is the Si4705 on /dev/radio0.
 *
 * WHAT HIBY'S DRIVER ACTUALLY DOES (radio-si4705-common.ko, disassembled 2026-10-09). It is not
 * the standard V4L2 RDS byte stream of three-byte blocks, and every one of these matters:
 *
 *  - RDS reception is OFF until someone poll()s the node for POLLIN. si4705_fops_poll() sends
 *    FM_RDS_STATUS and, if the chip is not in RDS sync, writes FM_RDS_INT_SOURCE=1,
 *    FM_RDS_INT_FIFO_COUNT=4 and FM_RDS_CONFIG=0xFF01 (RDSEN). Nothing else in the driver
 *    enables RDS, and stock FM2 never polls, which is half of why stock never showed RDS.
 *    poll() never reports the node readable; it is only the switch.
 *  - Each read() pops ONE whole group off the chip's FIFO (FM_RDS_STATUS with INTACK) and
 *    copies it out as  A (u16, host order), B (u16, host order), C D (4 bytes, MSB first),
 *    but only when the chip is in sync, nothing was lost, and block D is clean. The driver
 *    ignores the requested length.
 *  - read() returns 0 whether or not it copied anything (it returns copy_to_user's "bytes not
 *    copied"). So new data is detected by pre-filling the buffer and seeing whether it changed.
 *  - The stock driver copies only the first FOUR bytes, A and B, so C and D, which carry
 *    every character of the station name and of RadioText, never arrive. MikuOS patches that
 *    to eight (mikuos/build/patch_si4705_rds.py). On an unpatched driver C and D stay at the
 *    fill pattern, [wholeGroups] goes false, and only PI, PTY and the flags are decoded.
 *
 * WHY RAW SYSCALLS AND NOT File/FileInputStream. The vendor's sepolicy grants this app
 *
 *     allow vendor_fm_app vendor_fm_radio_device:chr_file { ioctl read write open };
 *
 * and nothing else. `getattr` is not in that set, so every call that stats the node is denied
 * and File.exists() says a present node is missing. Os.open/Os.poll/Os.read are bare syscalls
 * that need only what we hold. Nothing here may stat the node.
 *
 * WEAK SIGNAL. The chip only hands over groups whose block D passed, but A to C can still carry
 * corrected-but-wrong bits on a marginal carrier. A station name made of half-right letters is
 * worse than none, so a PS or RT segment is only accepted when the same characters arrive for it
 * twice in a row.
 *
 * Groups handled, which is what a now-playing display needs:
 *   0A/0B  PS, the eight-character station name, and the TA/TP/MS flags
 *   2A/2B  RT, the 64-character radio text, which is where most US stations put "Artist - Title"
 *   3A     ODA announcement, used to discover which group carries RT+
 *   RT+    tagged items inside RT: artist and title, as the station marked them
