/**
 * Should this station come in here, on this radio?
 *
 * The catalogue's score ranks stations against each other but cannot answer that, and the
 * nearby list was showing big-city stations from a valley where they had never once been heard. This turns transmitter power, height and distance into a predicted
 * level at the tuner's input in dBµV (the unit the Si4705's RSSI reports), then corrects that
 * prediction against what this device has actually measured.
 *
 * THE PATH MODEL. Without a terrain profile, Egli's empirical VHF formula (a plain-terrain fit
 * that already includes more loss than free space), plus an extra loss for every kilometre past
 * the radio horizon. With a profile (FmFresnel), the level is the lower of Egli and free space
 * less the terrain's diffraction loss. Diffraction loss in ITU-R P.526 is measured against free
 * space, so adding it on top of Egli, which already carries typical terrain loss, counted the
 * same hill twice. None of this is precise. It is meant to be right about "next town over"
 * versus "two counties and a ridge away", which is the question being asked.
 *
 * THE CALIBRATION. The antenna is a headphone cable and the listener is usually indoors, which
 * costs tens of dB that no formula knows about. So stations this device has measured (a band
 * sweep, or a steady reading while tuned) are compared with the prediction for them, terrain
 * included where known, and the median difference becomes the offset applied to everything.
 * It describes this device and its antenna, not a place, so it is kept across restarts. Until
 * anything has been measured, a default stands in for it.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT BEATS PREDICTION. A station read at a listenable level here is HEARD, whatever
 * the model or the terrain says; a full-power station whose frequency read at the noise floor
 * is NOT_HEARD.
 *
 * WHY A STRONG LOCAL STATION READ "OUT OF REACH" (2026-10-10). 50 kW, 152 m HAAT, close by, a
 * ridge 0.8 km from the listener about 110 m above the line of sight (~23 dB of diffraction).
 * The old sum was Egli 69.6 dBuV, less the -38 dB default offset, less 23 dB of terrain:
 * 8 dBuV, under the 12 dBuV threshold. But the -38 had been fitted without terrain, from a
 * reading of another station that was itself behind that ridge and taken while 100.1 could not be tuned
 * (the 200 kHz grid bug), so the ridge was in the offset and then subtracted again. Now:
 * min(Egli 69.6, free space 89.5 - 23.4) = 66.1, less the -25 dB default, is 41 dBuV: LIKELY,
 * and HEARD as soon as the tuner reads it.
