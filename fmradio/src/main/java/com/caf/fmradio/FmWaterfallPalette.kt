/**
 * The waterfall colour ramp.
 *
 * An SDR waterfall is conventionally navy to cyan to white, and that convention exists for a
 * reason: it is monotonic in perceived brightness, so a stronger signal always *looks*
 * stronger and the eye can rank two streaks without consulting a legend. Any replacement has
 * to keep that property or it stops being an instrument and becomes wallpaper.
 *
 * So this is Miku's palette arranged to satisfy the same constraint. Near-black navy for the
 * noise floor, through her teal, into cyan, and finally into her pink at the top of the scale
 * where the classic ramp would go white. Brightness rises the whole way; the hue shift is what
 * makes it hers.
 *
 * Interpolated rather than bucketed. Five hard colour bands turn a smooth noise floor into
 * visible contour steps, which reads as structure in the signal that is not there.
