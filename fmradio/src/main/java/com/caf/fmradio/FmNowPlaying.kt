/**
 * Tells the rest of MikuOS what the radio is playing, the same way Miku Music does.
 *
 *  - SystemUI's now-playing HUD (the "toast" that slides in over any app) listens for
 *    `com.miku.player.action.TRACK_CHANGED`. Radio songs go out on that broadcast with
 *    `openPackage=com.caf.fmradio`, so a tap opens the tuner, and the HUD stays quiet while the
 *    tuner is itself on screen.
 *  - The launcher widgets, AOD and lockscreen read Settings.Global `miku_now_playing_title` /
 *    `miku_now_playing_artist`. Those are written too, so they follow the radio while it plays.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A SONG. RT+ is the station saying "this is the artist, this is the title", so
 * a change there is a song change. Without RT+, RadioText is the best there is, but stations
 * also rotate slogans and phone numbers through it, so a plain RT change only announces when it
 * has been stable for [RT_SETTLE_MS] and differs from what was last announced, and never more
 * than once per [MIN_GAP_MS].
