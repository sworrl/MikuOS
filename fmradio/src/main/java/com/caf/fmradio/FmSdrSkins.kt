/**
 * The shapes a receiver panel can take, in the Miku palette.
 *
 * These are the conventions real SDR software settled on, and they are conventions rather than
 * decoration: each one answers a different question. The point of offering all of them is that
 * which question you are asking changes with what you are doing - aiming an antenna is not the
 * same job as finding a station or looking at what a signal is made of.
 *
 * Colour is NOT what varies between them. Every skin draws through [FmWaterfallPalette], so the
 * noise floor is the same navy and a strong signal is the same teal-to-pink no matter which one
 * is selected. What varies is the geometry and what gets annotated.
