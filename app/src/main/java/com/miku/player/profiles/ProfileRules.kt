/**
 * The rule that turns a headphone's published impedance and sensitivity into recommended DAC
 * settings. It is duplicated, deliberately and line for line, in
 * m500/tools/profiles/gen_listening_profiles.py, which bakes the built-ins; this copy exists for
 * custom profiles the user creates on the device. Change both or neither.
 *
 * THE RULE. Work out the voltage the headphone needs for 110 dB SPL peaks (loud listening with
 * headroom), from its sensitivity in dB SPL per volt:
 *     dB/V = dB/mW + 10·log10(1000 / Z)          (when the maker quotes dB/mW)
 *     Vneeded = 10^((110 − dB/V) / 20)
 *  - Vneeded < 0.5 V   → Low gain, High Power off  (nearly every IEM; sensitive portables)
 *  - 0.5 V to < 1.5 V  → High gain, High Power off (most 32–80 Ω full-size)
 *  - ≥ 1.5 V           → High gain, High Power on  (HD 600/650/800 class)
 * Without a sensitivity figure: IEMs and earbuds → Low/off; other wired headphones → by
 * impedance (≥ 150 Ω High/on, ≥ 50 Ω High/off, else Low/off).
 * Bluetooth-only hardware gets no DAC settings at all: the M500's DAC is not in that signal path.
 *
 * Filter: fast roll-off, phase compensated (linear phase; flattest passband, the CS43198
 * default in this app). NOS and the slow filters are taste, so they are the user's to choose.
 * DRE: on, matching the app's standing best-audio policy (MikuDirectAudio.ensureBestAudio).
 * DSD gain compensation: not set (it does nothing on this firmware; see DspKnob).
