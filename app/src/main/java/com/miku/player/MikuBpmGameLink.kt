/**
 * The one way Miku Music opens the BPM rhythm game. Every button that leads to the game goes
 * through [open], so they all behave the same and only this file knows the launcher's contract.
 *
 * The game is an exported activity in the MikuOS launcher. Started from an Activity context it is
 * deliberately NOT given FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK: it then stacks on top of Miku Music's own task,
 * and when the player leaves the game it finishes and they land back exactly where they were (Now
 * Playing stays Now Playing). NEW_TASK is only added when there is no Activity to stack on, since
 * Android requires it there.
 *
 * Older launchers have no game activity; for those it falls back to the original hand-off, the
 * launcher's own launch intent with the `open_bpm` extra.
