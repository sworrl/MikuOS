/**
 * READ-ONLY view of the cross-app unlocks earned in the BPM rhythm game.
 *
 * The game (in the launcher, `com.miku.launcher.bpm.MikuUnlocks`) is the ONLY writer. It keeps a
 * JSON object in `Settings.Global` under `miku_unlocks`:
 *
 *     {"<unlock_id>": {"at": <epochMillis>, "src": "bpm", "off": true}}
 *
 * "off" is optional. It means the player earned the reward and then switched it off from the
 * game's Secrets list. So there are two separate questions:
 *   - UNLOCKED: the key is present. Earned, whatever the switch says. Pickers use this.
 *   - ENABLED:  the key is present AND "off" is not true. Things that simply appear on their own
 *               (the leek on Now Playing) use this, because the player has no other way to say
 *               "not that one, thanks".
 *
 * Miku Music only reads it, to decide which cosmetics are available. The ids are copied here
 * verbatim and must never be renamed on either side: a renamed id silently re-locks something the
 * player already earned.
 *
 * FAILURE POSTURE: if the read throws or the value is missing, NOTHING is treated as unlocked.
 * Failing open would hand out every reward for free and make the game pointless; failing closed is
 * recoverable (play a few more taps, or the game re-grants on its next evaluate()).
