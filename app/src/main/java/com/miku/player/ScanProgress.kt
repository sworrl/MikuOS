/**
 * Process-wide, cross-thread scan status for [rescan]'s library scan. Plain @Volatile/Atomic
 * fields rather than Compose State — the walk phase can tick [visited] tens of thousands of
 * times a second across several worker threads, and writing Compose State that fast from
 * multiple background threads is both wasteful (a recomposition per tick) and not what it's
 * built for. The UI polls this on a timer instead (see ScannerPill), which naturally throttles
 * to a smooth update rate no matter how fast the scan itself is running.
