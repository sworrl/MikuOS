/**
 * Pure (no Android, no network) duration-based matching of a whole-disc image against MusicBrainz
 * media. Kept free of I/O so the thresholds can be reasoned about (and unit-tested) in isolation.
 *
 * The image's duration (from MediaStore) is THE disambiguator: artist + album finds candidate
 * releases, but only the medium whose summed track lengths reproduce the file's length is
 * accepted. Thresholds:
 *
 *  • [TOLERANCE_FRACTION] 1.5 % of the image length (never less than [MIN_TOLERANCE_MS]) either
 *    way. CD track lengths on MusicBrainz come from the TOC in whole frames, encoders pad the tail
 *    of the last track, and some rips drop the lead-out — all well inside 1.5 %.
 *  • plus [PREGAP_MS] of extra file length on top of that: a standard Red Book image carries the
 *    2-second track-1 pregap that the TOC's track lengths exclude.
 *  • A candidate is rejected as AMBIGUOUS (return null → image stays whole, never guessed) when
 *    a rival medium with a materially different track list fits within [AMBIGUITY_MARGIN_FRACTION]
 *    of the best one. Rivals with the same TOC (re-issues, country variants) are NOT ambiguity —
 *    any of them yields the same cut points.
