/**
 * Single reactive source of truth for liked tracks/albums/artists so every heart (rows, mini-bar,
 * now-playing, artist/album headers) stays in sync. Backed by Compose snapshot lists, persisted
 * via PlayerPreferences.
 *
 * Three independent tiers, deliberately NOT cascaded into each other's boolean state — liking an
 * album does not flip every track's heart, liking a track does not flip its album's heart. Each
 * tier is its own explicit signal. What DOES combine them is [TasteEngine], which reads all three
 * tiers to compute a soft, continuous affinity score per track/album/artist (an album you liked
 * implies you probably like its tracks somewhat, even ones you never individually hearted — see
 * that file for the actual weighting). This file only owns the three raw boolean signals.
 *
 * Albums/artists are keyed by [canonicalAlbumKey]/[canonicalArtistKey] (Model.kt) rather than raw
 * display strings — display names are formatted (and for artists, user-configurable via the
 * "ignore The" setting), so keying likes on them directly meant a like could silently orphan
 * itself the moment the display mode changed, and two different artists' identically-titled
 * albums would collide onto one shared like. (2026-08-17: switched from raw-name keys to this —
 * existing album/artist likes from before this change won't carry over, tracks aren't affected.)
