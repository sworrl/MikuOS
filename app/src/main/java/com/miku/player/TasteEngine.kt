/**
 * Local, on-device taste/affinity scoring — the "DNA" the three like tiers (LikeStore) build up.
 * Deliberately NOT a persisted feature store or a trained model: every score here is a cheap
 * weighted formula computed live off three tiny boolean sets (a handful of liked tracks/albums/
 * artists) plus data already sitting in memory (the current track/album/artist lists) — "neural
 * smart, IO easy," per the design brief. Nothing here writes to disk; LikeStore already owns the
 * only persisted state this needs.
 *
 * The idea: liking things at different tiers is correlated signal, not independent facts. Liking
 * a Track says a little about the Album and Artist it's on. Liking an Album says a LOT about its
 * Tracks (you didn't say you love all 12 songs individually, but you basically meant it) and a fair
 * amount about the Artist. Liking an Artist says a little about everything they've made. None of
 * this cascades into LikeStore's actual booleans — a liked album never flips individual track
 * hearts (that's a deliberate, separate design choice, see LikeStore's doc comment) — but it DOES
 * feed a continuous 0..1 "affinity" score per entity, which is what a future recommendation/
 * highlight feature would actually rank on, instead of just the boolean "is this exact thing
 * liked."
 *
 * Weights are tuned so a single explicit like at any tier is a strong signal on its own, and
 * alignment across tiers (you liked the song AND its album AND you like the artist) saturates
 * affinity at 1.0 well before "liked literally everything" — the whole point is that the more
 * signals point the same direction, the more confident the score gets.
