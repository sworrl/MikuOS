/**
 * Wire format between the M500 and the TV companion.
 *
 * ONE SOCKET, BOTH DIRECTIONS. An earlier sketch used a socket for audio and a second for
 * control. That needs the two to be correlated, re-paired after every Wi-Fi blip, and torn down
 * in step, for no benefit: control traffic is a few bytes a second next to a 4.6 Mbit audio
 * stream. Everything is framed on one connection instead, so a dropped link is unambiguous and
 * reconnecting restores both at once.
 *
 * FRAMING. Every frame is:
 *
 *     magic   4 bytes   "MIKU"
 *     type    1 byte    see below
 *     length  4 bytes   big-endian payload length
 *     payload length bytes
 *
 * The magic is on every frame rather than once at connect so a desynced reader can hunt forward
 * and resynchronise instead of having to drop the connection. With PCM on the wire a single
 * mis-framed read would otherwise turn into permanent noise.
 *
 * BYTE ORDER. PCM payloads are passed through EXACTLY as the decoder produced them, little-endian
 * as Android uses throughout. They are not converted to network order: this is a bit-perfect path
 * and a byte swap on each end is both pointless work and a chance to corrupt 24-bit packed audio.
 * The header fields are big-endian because that is the convention for framing, and they are the
 * only fields either side parses as numbers.
