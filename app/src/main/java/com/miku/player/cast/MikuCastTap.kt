/**
 * The point where PCM leaves for the TV.
 *
 * WHY HERE AND NOT MediaProjection. The obvious way to mirror a device's audio is
 * AudioPlaybackCapture, and it is the wrong way for us. That API taps AFTER the system mixer, so
 * what you capture has already been resampled to the mixer's rate (48 kHz here) and had every
 * other stream folded in. Mirroring a 24/96 FLAC through it would hand the TV 48 kHz of
 * already-degraded audio, which defeats the point of the device.
 *
 * We own the decoder, so we do not have to capture anything. [MikuDirectAudioSink] holds the
 * decoded buffer immediately before `AudioTrack.write`, at the file's native rate and depth,
 * having bypassed the mixer entirely (see the DIRECT output work). Teeing there means the samples
 * the TV receives are the samples in the file. That is bit-perfect mirroring, which the usual
 * capture route cannot do.
 *
 * COST. [offer] runs on the audio thread, once per buffer. It must never block, never allocate
 * beyond a copy, and never throw, or it will glitch playback on the device itself. Everything here
 * is written to that constraint: a bounded ring, a copy, an index bump. If no TV is listening it
 * returns on the first line.
