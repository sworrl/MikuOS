 * App-wide "color of what's playing". One process-global palette extracted from the CURRENT
 * track's art (not whatever happened to be in the memory cache at first composition — that was
 * why the mini bar so often stayed default teal while the art was clearly orange). Every chrome
 * surface reads [colors] and animates toward the new palette on track change, so the whole app
 * shifts with the album instead of only the Now Playing card.
 *
 * Fallback is always the Miku teal identity palette (no art → nothing changes visibly).
