/**
 * Wire contract for the "Miku Remote" Bluetooth LE GATT service.
 *
 * The M500 is the GATT PERIPHERAL (server). A phone needs no app: the companion PWA
 * (tools/remote-pwa) connects with Web Bluetooth, pairs with the 6-digit code shown in Settings,
 * then subscribes to now-playing/volume notifications and writes plain-text commands.
 *
 * All characteristic payloads are UTF-8 text. JSON where structured, `verb[:arg]` for commands.
 * Every string here is mirrored verbatim in tools/remote-pwa/app.js — change both together.
 *
 * Base UUID 39c5bbXX-4d49-4b55-9d31-3f8a6e7c2a01: "39c5bb" is Miku teal (#39C5BB), "4d494b55"
 * is ASCII "MIKU". Fixed for the life of the product so the PWA's filter never has to change.
