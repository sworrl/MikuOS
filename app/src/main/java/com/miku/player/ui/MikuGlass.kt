/**
 * Glass panels, with the live backdrop blur OFF by default on this hardware.
 *
 * WHY. The main content area was a haze SOURCE and the header, the mini player and several
 * sheets were haze CHILDREN blurring whatever scrolled under them. Haze does that by recording
 * the whole source region into its own layer every frame and running a RenderEffect blur over it,
 * so every scroll frame drew the entire list twice and then blurred it. Profiled 2026-09-19 on the
 * artist list: draw was 43% of the UI thread, the largest single cost left after the accessibility
 * fix, and the Snapdragon 665 has no headroom for it. The panels sit on 90 to 95 percent opaque
 * gradients anyway, so the blur under them was barely visible.
 *
 * NOW. Blur is a runtime setting, `settings put global miku_glass_blur 1`, default off. Off, a
 * panel is the same shape with the same tint, no blur and no second draw of the content. The
 * option stays because the look is real; it is just not worth 40% of the frame budget here.
