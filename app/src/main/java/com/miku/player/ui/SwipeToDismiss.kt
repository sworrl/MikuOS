 * Swipe-up-from-the-bottom-to-dismiss gesture for MikuOS full-screen modals, matching the system
 * gesture-nav feel: a drag that STARTS in the bottom [BOTTOM_START_FRACTION] of this composable
 * and travels upward past [DISMISS_DISTANCE] calls [onDismiss] exactly once.
 *
 * Safe to place on the ROOT container of a modal:
 * - Runs in the Main pointer pass, so inner scrollables/draggables (which see events before this
 *   parent) that claim the gesture cancel it — inner scrolling and games are never broken.
 * - Nothing is consumed until the drag passes touch slop AND is moving upward, so taps, clicks,
 *   and downward drags fall through to the modal's own content untouched.
 * - Drags beginning above the bottom band are ignored entirely.
 * - Drags beginning inside a SYSTEM gesture band of the window (bottom 32dp = home/recents, the
 *   side/top bands too — see [SystemGestureEdges]) are left entirely to the MikuOS nav layer:
 *   the modal only answers a swipe that starts in its bottom 15% but ABOVE the OS's home strip.
