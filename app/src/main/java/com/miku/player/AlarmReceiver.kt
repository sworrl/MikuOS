/**
 * CPU wake lock bridging the gap between AlarmManager's broadcast and [[AlarmRingService]]
 * actually holding its own locks. AlarmManager only guarantees the device stays awake for the
 * duration of `onReceive()`; on a dozing device the foreground-service start that follows is
 * asynchronous, so without this the CPU could legally drop back to suspend before
 * `onStartCommand` runs (the classic WakefulBroadcastReceiver problem). Timed (90 s) so a crash
 * anywhere in between can never pin the CPU forever; the service releases it explicitly the
 * moment it holds its own per-ring locks.
