/**
 * Turns off Compose's accessibility semantics machinery when the ONLY accessibility service on the
 * device is MikuOS's own navigation service, which never reads content.
 *
 * WHY. On MikuOS an accessibility service is the navigation: the home pill, the back edges and
 * the shade pull all live in com.miku.systemui's AccessibilityService, so it is always enabled.
 * Compose decides whether to maintain its semantics tree with one test, "is any accessibility
 * service enabled", and does not care whether that service can or ever will read window content.
 * So every Compose screen in every app on the device rebuilt its semantics node map, computed
 * every node's window bounds and diffed the structure ON EVERY LAYOUT PASS, for a consumer that
 * does not exist. Profiled 2026-09-19 while scrolling the artist list: the accessibility delegate
 * (getCurrentSemanticsNodes, checkForSemanticsChanges, sendAccessibilitySemanticsStructureChangeEvents)
 * was 35 to 40 percent of the UI thread's time, ahead of measure, layout and draw combined.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES. Marks the content view IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO_HIDE_DESCENDANTS, which
 * removes the whole subtree from the accessibility tree and lets the delegate skip it. It does
 * this ONLY when the nav service is the sole enabled service. The moment a real screen reader
 * (TalkBack, or anything not ours) is enabled, this leaves the view alone and the app is fully
 * accessible again. A blind user is never locked out to save frames; a sighted user on a device
 * with no screen reader is not paying for one.
