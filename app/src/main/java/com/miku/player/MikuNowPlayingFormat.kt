/**
 * Publisher for `Settings.Global.miku_now_playing_format`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Three OS surfaces read that key — the launcher status bar's quality chip, the
 * lockscreen's format badge and the anatomical observatory's now-playing pill — and until now
 * nothing in the tree ever wrote it. Each consumer had been taught, separately, to render the
 * absence honestly ("— (not published)", a hidden badge, an empty chip), which was the right call
 * at the time but left three dead surfaces. Before that they were worse than dead: the observatory
 * read the unset key as "idle" and declared the device idle with music playing, and the lockscreen
 * fell back to a hardcoded "DTA 24/96" that was a pure invention.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. [onTrackInitialized] is called from the sink immediately after the
 * real [AudioTrack] is constructed, and reads [AudioTrack.getFormat] — the format the platform
 * actually GRANTED, not the one we asked for. That distinction is the whole point. The request can
 * be refused (see the platform-minimum buffer fallback in MikuDirectAudioSink) and the policy can
 * land the track on a mixer at a different rate than the file; reading back means the chip shows
 * what is really on the wire.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. It never prints "DIRECT" or "bit-perfect". There is no
 * public API to read an AudioTrack's granted output flags, so a DIRECT claim would be an inference
 * dressed as a measurement, which is exactly the class of defect the fake-data sweeps exist to
 * remove. What it can state as fact is whether the sink resampled: output rate against the decoded
 * input rate is a comparison of two known numbers. "native" means those matched. Nothing more.
 *
 * STRING SHAPE. "24-bit 96 kHz" leads, always, because the status bar parses bit depth and rate
 * out of it with a regex that takes the first match. Qualifiers follow after "·" and use a bare
 * "k" rather than a second "kHz" so they cannot be mistaken for the headline rate.
