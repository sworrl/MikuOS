/**
 * The real gate for the BPM-game visualiser rewards.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The rewards "Negi Rain", "Vocaloid Circuit" and "Vortex Core" used to gate
 * ShaderPreset ordinals 3/4 and ProjectMPreset ordinal 3. On a working device neither does
 * anything: the GLES2 shader engine only runs when libprojectM failed to load, and nothing ever
 * saves a ProjectMPreset while the native setPreset is a no-op. What the player actually SEES is
 * projectM shuffling every .milk file in filesDir/presets, and the Miku look ships there as eight
 * files per family ("Miku - Negi Rain 01 (Teal).milk" ...). So the gate has to act on the files.
 *
 * HOW. Before every playlist load, each gated family's files are moved out of the presets dir into
 * a sibling vault (filesDir/presets_vault) while the reward is not earned, and moved back once it
 * is. The vault is a SIBLING, not a child, because the native side adds the presets dir
 * recursively. Only explicit filenames are touched, taken from the assets/miku_presets listing
 * (read once per process): the presets dir holds ~9.8k files and is never listed here.
 *
 * Re-applied after ensurePresets on every load, so a library re-sync (which copies all of
 * miku_presets back in, locked families included) is put right before projectM ever sees it.
