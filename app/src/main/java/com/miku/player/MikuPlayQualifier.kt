/**
 * Tracks whether the CURRENT play of a track qualifies to earn a heart: the user must hear at
 * least [THRESHOLD] (94%) of it WITHOUT skipping — no jump to the next track before then, and no
 * forward-scrub past the threshold to fake completion. Each qualifying play grants exactly ONE
 * heart opportunity (you can heart it once per full listen; play it through again to heart again).
 *
 * Single-process: PlayerHolder (playback), the now-playing heart UI, and LikeStore all live in
 * com.miku.player, so this in-memory state is the shared source of truth. The "heartable" flag is
 * also mirrored to Settings.Global miku_current_track_heartable for any out-of-process surface.
