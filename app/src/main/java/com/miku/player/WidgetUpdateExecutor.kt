/**
 * Off-main-thread dispatch for widget re-renders. `Player.Listener` callbacks
 * (onIsPlayingChanged, onMediaMetadataChanged) fire on the main thread, and both
 * MikuMusicWidget.pushUpdate and MikuTapeWidget.pushUpdate do blocking ContentResolver I/O
 * (loadThumbnail) plus, for the tape widget, ~50 Canvas draw calls building a fresh 640×400
 * bitmap (MiniTapeRenderer) — real work that used to run synchronously on the main thread on
 * every single play/pause toggle or track change, a genuine dropped-frame risk.
 *
 * Single-thread executor: widget renders are cheap enough to serialize, and serializing avoids
 * two renders racing on the same underlying player/bitmap state. Coalesced via a pending flag —
 * a metadata change immediately followed by a play-state change (the common track-transition
 * case) collapses into one actual render pass instead of two, and any pushes that arrive while a
 * render is already in flight are dropped rather than queued (the in-flight render already
 * reflects the latest player state by the time it reads it).
