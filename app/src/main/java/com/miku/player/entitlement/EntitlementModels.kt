/**
 * Remote entitlement ("kill-switch") data model.
 *
 * Design invariants (see EntitlementDecision for the full table):
 *  - Only a SIGNED, nonce-matched, unexpired, clock-sane server response ever produces a
 *    [VerdictRecord]. Everything else is a [CheckOutcome] that is displayed but NOT recorded as a
 *    verdict, so it can never contribute to a lockout.
 *  - A DISALLOW verdict on its own never blocks anything; the decision layer requires a run of
 *    consecutive signed disallows spanning a grace window.
