/**
 * Where the device is, from every source it has, published once for the whole OS.
 *
 * The M500 has three ways to know: a GNSS receiver, a 4G modem, and the Wi-Fi it can hear.
 * Each is wrong in a different way. GNSS is the most accurate and the most expensive, and
 * indoors it is often simply absent. The modem's network location is cheap and coarse. Wi-Fi
 * positioning through BeaconFix Lite is cheap after the first lookup, works indoors, and is
 * the only one of the three that gets *better* the more you use a place.
 *
 * So this does not pick a favourite. It takes whichever fix is best right now, judged on
 * accuracy and age together, and says which one it used. Anything that wants a position reads
 * one set of Settings.Global keys and does not care how it was obtained.
 *
 * BATTERY. This is the thing that burned a Pixel: BeaconFix proper held GNSS at high accuracy
 * every 2.5 seconds for days. Nothing here polls GNSS. It registers for passive updates, so it
 * sees any fix some *other* app already paid for and costs nothing when nothing else is asking.
 * Wi-Fi is consulted on the Lite library's own schedule, which backs off to two hours while
 * nothing changes and tightens to two minutes when the device has moved. An active GNSS request
 * happens only when something explicitly asks for a sharp fix, and stops as soon as it has one.
