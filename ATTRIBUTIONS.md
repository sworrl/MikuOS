# Attributions and licensing

This file records what is in this project, who made it, and under what license. It covers the
MikuOS repo and the [MikuMusic](https://github.com/sworrl/MikuMusic) repo, which ships the player,
launcher, system UI, settings and hardware apps.

Corrections are welcome. If something here is wrong, or something is missing, open an issue.

## 2. Hatsune Miku and Crypton Future Media

Hatsune Miku, the character name, and the associated character designs are the property of
Crypton Future Media, Inc. This project is unaffiliated with Crypton and is not endorsed by
Crypton. It is a hobby project for a device Crypton licensed to HiBy Digital.

Crypton publishes the Piapro Character License (PCL) for non-commercial derivative works of their
characters. Original art made for this project is intended to sit inside that framework. The PCL
does not grant any right to redistribute artwork that a third party made under a separate license
from Crypton, which is the subject of section 3.2.

---

## 3. Artwork

Artwork in this project falls into three groups. They have different provenance and different
licensing positions, so they are listed separately.

### 3.1 Generated with an image model

A portion of the Miku artwork in this project was produced with a generative image model, not drawn
by a human artist. That includes the renders under `miku-assets/miku_renders/` and its `banners/`
subdirectory, the images under `miku-assets/reference_favorites/`, and several of the theme
wallpapers under `miku-assets/themes/`.

These are derivative works of Crypton's character design. They were made for this project and are
non-commercial. They are not the work of any human artist and are not presented as such.

We would rather ship art made by people. See [section 7](#7-we-are-looking-for-real-art).

### 3.2 Extracted from the stock M500 firmware

Some images in this project were taken off a stock HiBy Digital M500. They are HiBy's files,
depicting Crypton's character, and there is no license here to redistribute either layer.

Known instances:

| Location | Files | Origin |
|---|---|---|
| `miku-assets/official-device/` | `ic_sprite.png`, `miku_background_view.png`, `miku_default_cover.png`, `clock_widget_miku_preview.png` | Extracted from stock M500 firmware. **Removed from the tree on 2026-09-27.** Nothing in the build used them. They remain in git history |
| MikuMusic `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/` | `wall_paper_0`..`9`, `miku_wall_00`..`09`, `miku_extra_00`..`17`, `miku_sprite`, `miku_cover`, `miku_clock_preview`, `miku_wallpaper` | Same, renamed and re-encoded |
| MikuMusic `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/` | The `ic_*_miku` themed launcher icon set (about 60 files, including icons for WeChat, Zhihu, Bilibili, Ximalaya, Kugou, Kuwo, QQ and other Chinese-market apps) | Stock M500 theme set |

Owning the device licenses the copy on the device. It does not license redistribution, and gating
our code to M500 hardware does not change that.

The intended end state is that the build extracts these from the stock firmware the user already
owns, and the repos ship only art we made. That work is not done. Until it is, the accurate
statement is that these files are present and should not be.

**Takedown:** if you are HiBy Digital or Crypton Future Media and want any of this removed, open an
issue or email github@falcontechnix.com. It will be removed.

### 3.3 Original

`miku-assets/falcon_technix_logo.webp` is the project's own brand mark.

Screenshots under `docs/screenshots/` are captures of this software running on the author's own
device. They necessarily contain artwork covered by 3.1 and 3.2.

## 4. Fonts

## 5. Libraries

### 5.1 Linked at build time

| Library | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AndroidX and Jetpack Compose | Apache-2.0 | Google |
| Kotlin standard library and coroutines | Apache-2.0 | JetBrains |
| Media3 / ExoPlayer | Apache-2.0 | Google. One class is forked, see 5.3 |
| OkHttp (`com.squareup.okhttp3`) | Apache-2.0 | Square |
| Coil (`io.coil-kt`, `coil-compose`, `coil-gif`) | Apache-2.0 | Coil Contributors |
| Haze (`dev.chrisbanes.haze`) | Apache-2.0 | Chris Banes |
| WireGuard for Android (`com.wireguard.android:tunnel`) | Apache-2.0 | "WireGuard" is a registered trademark of Jason A. Donenfeld |
| jaudiotagger (`net.jthink`) | LGPL-2.1-or-later | Used as a library, not modified |
| libVLC and medialibrary (`org.videolan.android`) | LGPL-2.1-or-later | VideoLAN. Used as a library, not modified |

### 5.2 Vendored source

| Component | Location | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| libprojectM | `miku-player-kotlin/app/src/main/cpp/vendor/projectm` | LGPL-2.1 | Tracked at upstream master (4.2.0). Built as a library and linked; not modified |
| fastboot.js (`android-fastboot` 1.1.3) | `tools/web-installer/js/vendor/` | MIT, Copyright (c) 2021 Danny Lin | Byte-identical to the npm `dist/fastboot.min.mjs`, not modified. Its own `LICENSE.fastboot.js.txt` and `NOTICE.txt` ship alongside it |

### 5.3 Forked code

`androidx.media3.exoplayer.audio.MikuDirectAudioSink` is a modified copy of Media3's
`DefaultAudioSink` (Apache-2.0, Google), carried in our source tree under the original package name
so it can reach package-private members. The modification is the buffer sizing that keeps the track
out of Android's deep-buffer path. Apache-2.0 terms apply to the original code.

### 5.4 Visualizer presets

The preset pack shipped in the player's assets is drawn from the MilkDrop and projectM preset
community. Individual presets carry their own authorship and terms, which vary and in many cases are
not stated. Presets written for this project are named `Miku - *.milk`. If you authored a preset in
the pack and want it credited differently or removed, open an issue.

---

## 6. Not redistributed

These are required to build or run MikuOS and are deliberately NOT in either repo. You supply them
from the device you own.

- **HiBy Digital**: the stock firmware, bootloader, vendor partition, audio HAL, and HiBy's own
  applications. The build scripts expect you to provide your own extracted copy.
- **Qualcomm**: proprietary components in the vendor image, under their own licenses.
- **Google**: GMS and related components, under their own licenses.

No prebuilt MikuOS super image is published for download, because a super image would contain the
above.

---

## 7. We are looking for real art

The Miku artwork in this project is either generated by a model or taken off the stock device.
Neither is where it should end up.

If you draw, and you would like your work in an OS that a small number of people use daily on a
music player, this is an open invitation. What is needed:

- **Wallpapers** at 720x1280, the panel's native resolution.
- **A default album-art placeholder**, square.
- **Launcher icon themes**. The current themed icon set is HiBy's and has to go.
- **A lockscreen and always-on-display treatment.**
- **Boot splash art.**

Terms, so there are no surprises: the project is GPL-3.0-or-later and non-commercial, and it is a
derivative work of Crypton's character, so contributed Miku art needs to sit within the Piapro
Character License. You keep your copyright. You are credited here by whatever name you want, and
you can ask for your work to be pulled at any time and it will be.

Open an issue or a pull request.
